						<h2> Adobe After Effects is a digital visual effect, motion graphics, and compositing application 
						developed by Adobe Systems and used in the post-production process of film making, video games, 
						and television production. Among other things, After Effects can be used for keying, tracking, 
						compositing, and animation. It also functions as a very basic non-linear editor, audio editor, 
						and media transcoder. In 2019, the program won an Academy Award for scientific and technical achievement.</h2>

						<h2> I started using Adobe After Effects only in the summer of 2020. I still find it difficult to
						use, because the design seems non-intuitive to me and is different both from Adobe Premiere Pro and
						Vegas Pro. My experience with it is very small and I still don't know how to use many of its 
						features. Despite that, I have successfully used it numerous times to generate a "sparks" effect,
						"blood splatter" effect, to hide my acne, and to generate a simple "synthwave" video. If you have more questions,
						feel free to use contacts on the <a href="index.html" target="_blank">Home Page</a>.

			<h3>In the first age, in the first video, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood.
				Burned by the embers of tutorials, his soul blistered by the fires of Vegas Pro and tainted beyond
				ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with
				boiling blood he scoured the Youtube seeking vengeance against the channels who had wronged him.
				He wore the crown of the Video Editors, and those that tasted the bite of his .mp4 named him... 
				Nazar Yaremus. @2020</h3>
