					<h3> My name is Nazar Yaremus. Born in 2002, graduating school in 2019, I am now a sophromore in LCC International University. 
					My hobbies are playing video games (don't doubt I am the best) and editing videos (also pretty good here). 
					This fan page is dedicated to the second hobby. In the header you can find links to web pages, each dedicated to one aspect of my skills in video editing: 
					Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, and Adobe After Effects. Don't hesitate to check.

			<h3>In the first age, in the first video, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood.
				Burned by the embers of tutorials, his soul blistered by the fires of Vegas Pro and tainted beyond
				ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with
				boiling blood he scoured the Youtube seeking vengeance against the channels who had wronged him.
				He wore the crown of the Video Editors, and those that tasted the bite of his .mp4 named him... 
				Nazar Yaremus. @2020</h3>
