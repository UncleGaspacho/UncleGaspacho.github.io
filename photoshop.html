					<h3>Quite frankly, my Photoshop skills are not as high because I do not work in it as often, as in video
					editing software. However, Photoshop is still integrated with the process of editing video so
					occasionally I use it. I can do basic things in it and if don't know something, I will just google how
					to do it. However, I rarely do it, because, usually, my skills were enough in what I did so far. Some of
					my skills:</h3>
					<h3>- cutting out objects;</h3>
					<h3>- removing objects from the photo;</h3>
					<h3>- removing acne from a face;</h3>
					<h3>- swapping faces.</h3>

			<h3>In the first age, in the first video, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood.
				Burned by the embers of tutorials, his soul blistered by the fires of Vegas Pro and tainted beyond
				ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with
				boiling blood he scoured the Youtube seeking vengeance against the channels who had wronged him.
				He wore the crown of the Video Editors, and those that tasted the bite of his .mp4 named him... 
				Nazar Yaremus. @2020</h3>
