						<h2> Adobe Premiere Pro is a timeline-based video editing software application developed by Adobe

						Adobe Premiere Pro is a successor of Adobe Premiere. It is geared towards professional video editing
						, while its sibling, Adobe Premiere Elements, targets the consumer market.  </h2>

						<h2> I switched to <b>Premiere Pro</b> only a few months ago. Prior to that, I had  2.5 years of experience 
						with <b>Vegas Pro 13.0</b> but at some point, I decided that if I want to advance with my video editing 
						skills, I need to switch to <b>Adobe Premiere Pro</b> because it gives more tools and possibilities. In 
						addition, <b>Adobe Premiere Pro</b> has a workflow with <b>Adobe After Effects</b>, which allows working with 
						special effects. Now I have, for the most part, mastered <b>Premiere Pro</b> and am capable of doing even 
						more than I did in <b>Vegas Pro 13</b>. I often use Premiere with a supplementary application:

			<h3>In the first age, in the first video, when the shadows first lengthened, one stood.
				Burned by the embers of tutorials, his soul blistered by the fires of Vegas Pro and tainted beyond
				ascension, he chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred he found no peace; and with
				boiling blood he scoured the Youtube seeking vengeance against the channels who had wronged him.
				He wore the crown of the Video Editors, and those that tasted the bite of his .mp4 named him... 
				Nazar Yaremus. @2020</h3>
